Simple-PHP-API
==============

A simple php-based API script.

This script will create a simple API to obtain data via a MySQL database, outputing the data to both JSON or XML.

The output can be determined by using "?format=json" or "?format=xml" at the end of the URL string.

I use 'get.php' as the filename, but you can use whatever name you require.
